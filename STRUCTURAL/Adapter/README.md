# Adapter Pattern
* Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
* Adapter lets classes work together, that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

# Applicability
* When you want to reuse existing class, but its interface is not compatible with the rest of application's code.
* You need to reuse several existing classes, but they lack some common functionality. And you can not add it to the superclass because it is either closed or used in other code.
