# Singleton  Pattern
* Ensure that only one instance of a class is created.
* Provide a global point of access to the object.

# Applicability
* When program should have a single instance of a class, available to all clients. For example, a single database object, shared by different parts of the program.
* When you need a stricter control over global variables.
