# Abstract Factory Pattern
* Abstract Factory offers the interface for creating a family of related.
* objects, without explicitly specifying their classes. 

# Applicability 
*  When a business logic must work with different variants of products from some product family, but you do not want it to depend on concrete product classes (or if they are unknown beforehand).
* When a class has multiple Factory Methods that blur its main responsibility.
