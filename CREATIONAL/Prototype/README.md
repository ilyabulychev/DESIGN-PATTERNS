# Prototype Pattern
* Specifying the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance.
* Creating new objects by copying this prototype.

# Applicability 
* When your code should not depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy. For examples, when objects' classes are unknown since you work with them via an interface.
* When you want to reduce the size of a class hierarchy that consists of similar objects, configured in different ways (in other words, each class would have unique field values).
