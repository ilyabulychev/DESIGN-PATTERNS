# Factory Method Pattern
* Defines an interface for creating objects, but let subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.
* Refers the newly created object through a common interface.

# Applicability 
* When the types and dependencies of objects with which your code should work are unknown in advance.
* When you want to enable users to expand parts of your framework or library.
