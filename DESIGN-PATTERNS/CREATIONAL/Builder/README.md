# Builder Pattern
* The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. By doing so the same construction process can create different representations.

# Applicability 
* Allows you to vary a productâ€™s internal representation.
* Encapsulates code for construction and representation.
* Provides control over steps of construction process.
