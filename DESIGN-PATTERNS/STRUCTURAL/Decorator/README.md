# Decorator Pattern
* The intent of this pattern is to add additional responsibilities dynamically to an object.

# Applicability
* When you need to dynamically assign the behaviors to objects without breaking the code that uses these objects.
* When it is not possible or awkward to extend the object behavior with inheritance.
