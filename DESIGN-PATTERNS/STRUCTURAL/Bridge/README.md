# Bridge Pattern
* The intent of this pattern is to decouple abstraction from implementation so that the two can vary independently.

# Applicability
* When you have a huge class that has several variants of some functionality (for example, works with different database servers).
* When you need to extend a class in several independent dimensions.
* When you need to be able to change implementation at runtime.
