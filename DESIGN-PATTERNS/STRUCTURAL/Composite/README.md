# Composite Pattern

* The intent of this pattern is to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
* Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

# Applicability
* When you have to implement a tree-like structure that has simple elements and containers.
* When Clients should treat simple and complex elements uniformly.
